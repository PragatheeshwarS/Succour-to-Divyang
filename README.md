Today, the world has about 295 million visually impaired people (VIP). VIP are naturally dependent on others to complete their tasks, not just at a physical level but at Psychological level.
In this study, we present a novel framework to assist the VIP in object detection and
recognition, so that they can be aware of their surroundings and navigate independently, GPS and fall detection which keeps their relatives updated of their status. With these the VIPs become more productive and independent.
The white cane is the most popular blind navigating device. This was further improved by the addition of ultrasonic and IR sensors to detect obstacles in the vicinity of the VIP and provide feedback in the form of vibration or sound. Though this approach was useful for the mobility of the visually impaired user, it provided little or no information about the surroundings.
For the user to have a better understanding of the surrounding, objection detection and
classification, followed by recognition and audio feedback is crucial.
Neural networks, particularly, convolutional neural networks have shown promising
results especially in object detection, classification, and recognition tasks from images.
